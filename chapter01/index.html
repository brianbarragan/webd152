    <p>I like different types of coffee but I definitely prefer blonde roasts due to their lighter flavor. Getting a coffee black is not for me though I definitely prefer having some cream and sugar in their. This is if I was getting a drip or iced coffee but I prefer lattes over anything. My go to lattes are usually white mocha or vanilla. I will always subistitute the milk for soy though since I enjoy the flavor of it more.</p>
